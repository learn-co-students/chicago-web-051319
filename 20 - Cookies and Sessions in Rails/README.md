# Rails Quest
We have a pre-built trivia app which presents the user with questions in succession, and allows them to answer.
We can check in our controller whether the user answered correctly or not, but how can we get the server to 'remember' how many questions a user has answered correctly for as long as they are on the site?

## Deliverables
* Add a feature which displays the number of questions a user has answered correctly
* Add a message which tells the user whether or not they got the last answer correct
