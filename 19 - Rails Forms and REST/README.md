# Rails Forms and REST

Goals for the hour:

1) Mini-review private methods
2) Review rails routing and controller setup
3) Connect familiar page/form elements to their "Railsy" equivalents
4) Refactor a form to work "The Rails way"
5) Build a Rails form from scratch (with help from the docs!)
6) Understand the "why" "what" and "how" of strong params
